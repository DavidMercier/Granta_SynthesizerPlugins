# Granta_SynthesizerPlugins
Examples of user-defined "Synthesizer" plugins in Ansys Granta softwares

The Synthesizer is an add-on software tool for Ansys Granta EduPack™ and Granta Selector™
that enables the performance of architectured and composite materials to be estimated, 
based on the properties of ‘standard’ materials in the installed databases.

Although the Synthesizer Tool is supplied with a range of standard models, it is also possible to add your own.
The aim of this document (and associated sample files) is to show you how to write, create, 
and run your own custom model in the Synthesizer Tool.
In order to implement a custom model successfully, you will need:
- Access to Microsoft Visual Studio. 
- Administrator rights on your PC. 
- Details of your model calculations.
